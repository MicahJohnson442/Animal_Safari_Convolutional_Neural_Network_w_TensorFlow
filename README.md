# Animal_Safari_Convolutional_Neural_Network_w_TensorFlow
In this project, I used a Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies images of animals you might find on a Safari Adventure. 
I used four animals with each animal having a hundred different pictures of it. Each picture is of an animal you would find on a Safari Adventure. 
Training images were ran and the shape of the images (which indicates the dimensions of the image and its color channels) were taken in. 
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning neural network that is commonly used in computer vision. 
It can learn to extract features from images or videos by applying filters or kernels to the input data. 
A CNN consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. 
The hidden layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 

A convolutional layer performs a dot product of the filter with a small region of the input data, producing a feature map that represents the presence of a certain feature in that region.
A pooling layer reduces the size of the feature map by applying a function such as max, average, or sum to a subregion of the map. 
A fully connected layer connects every neuron in the previous layer to every neuron in the next layer and performs a logistic function such as sigmoid or softmax to produce the final output.
